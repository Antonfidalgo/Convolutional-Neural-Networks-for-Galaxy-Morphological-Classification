# üåå Convolutional Neural Networks for Galaxy Morphological Classification

Welcome to the repository of my **Bachelor Thesis** at **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (Department of Mathematics)**.  
This work applies **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to the classification of galaxy morphology using astronomical imaging data.

The aim is to automate a traditionally manual process, improving **accuracy, scalability, and reproducibility**, and to provide tools that support the astronomical community in analyzing the massive datasets produced by modern sky surveys.

## üìñ Abstract

Since the dawn of humanity, we have shown a timeless fascination with the heavens, seeking to understand the universe that surrounds us.  
In today‚Äôs age of **data-intensive science**, the study of galaxy morphology plays a fundamental role in astrophysics.  

The objective of this thesis is to apply **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to galaxy morphological classification. A mathematical and computational approach is developed to enhance the **accuracy, scalability, and automation** of this task, traditionally performed manually.

This work aims to contribute a complementary tool for the astronomical community that can accelerate the analysis of large-scale datasets from modern sky surveys, and thus support humanity‚Äôs ongoing effort to understand the universe.

## üß† Methodology

1. **Dataset**

   * Based on **Galaxy Zoo** (original dataset \~500,000 galaxies).
   * Reduced to \~120,000 balanced images across 8 morphological classes.

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Image resizing & normalization
   * Label encoding and one-hot encoding
   * Train/validation/test splits

3. **CNN Architecture**

   * Convolutional layers: 32 ‚Üí 64 ‚Üí 128 filters (3x3 kernels)
   * ReLU activations, Batch Normalization
   * MaxPooling and Dropout for regularization
   * Global Average Pooling
   * Dense(256) fully-connected layer
   * Output: Softmax over 8 classes

4. **Training**

   * Optimizer: **Adam**
   * Loss: **Categorical Crossentropy**
   * Callbacks: EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau
   * Framework: TensorFlow/Keras
   * Hardware: NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU (CUDA)

5. **Evaluation**

   * Metrics: Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC
   * Confusion matrix analysis
   * Tests for robustness under image rotations
