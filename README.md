# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-for-Galaxy-Morphological-Classification
This thesis applies Convolutional Neural Networks to galaxy morphological classification using astronomical images. By automating a task traditionally done manually, it enhances accuracy and scalability, providing a tool to accelerate the analysis of large-scale sky survey datasets.
